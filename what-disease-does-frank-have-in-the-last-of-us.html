By the time the end credits rolled on ‘Long Long Time’, our hearts were collectively broken. Even though we spent almost an entire hour with these characters, it still didn’t feel like enough.</p><p data-characters=187 data-current-count=187 data-injectable=false>The question lingering on everyone’s mind right now is what exactly is the ailment that brought Frank down?

So, it’s time to play doctor and diagnose him based on what we know.</p><p data-characters=431 data-current-count=716 data-injectable=true>After the 10-year time skip following the night that Bill and Frank’s home was unsuccessfully raided, we see a noticeably aged Frank using a wheelchair, indicating that he has extremely limited mobility. We also see the motor function in his upper body has deteriorated substantially, along with his ability to paint as seen clearly in his portrait of Bill. The third clue would be Frank mentioning that the ailment is incurable.</p><p data-characters=453 data-current-count=453 data-injectable=true>On <a href=#>HBO’s The Last of Us Podcast</a>, showrunner Craig Mazin confirmed that Frank suffered from a neurodegenerative condition, which was either multiple sclerosis (MS) or early Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), however he notes that he did not want to specify which exact disease it was. While Frank’s speech was not yet impaired, both conditions eventually affect facial nerves and muscles, which is perhaps why Frank chose to end his life.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=235 data-current-count=235 data-injectable=false>A similar narrative thread was seen in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Scrubs</a> season seven episode six, titled ‘My Number One Doctor,’ in which an ALS patient named Shannon attempts to self-euthanize while they are still able to use their upper extremities.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMCtZJ2ho5qutLGMnaaeq12bv6K6ymafmq6VYravedOhnGakkajBbrvFZqysZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
