Mixing two formulas won't cause any dangerous reactions or explosions, but it could turn your coolant into a sludgy chemical mixture that won't be able to flow properly through your cooling system.</description></item><item><title>Elevator to the Gallows movie review (2005)</title><link>/elevator-to-the-gallows-2005.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/elevator-to-the-gallows-2005.html</guid><description>Because Julien has access and a motive, he must make this a perfect crime.
