The two have been at odds the past couple of weeks and now McIntyre made it clear that he will go after CM Punk until he cracks.</p><p>On last week’s episode of Monday Night RAW, Drew McIntyre and CM Punk engaged in a heated verbal exchange. Punk asserted that McIntyre lacked speaking skills and issued a threat, stating he would punch McIntyre’s teeth down his throat.</p><p>The Scottish Warrior would then follow it up by calling out <a href=#>CM Punk’s hypocrisy in scathing rant</a>. While speaking in an <a href=#>interview with ReviewSTL</a>, Drew McIntyre expressed his anticipation of facing Cody Rhodes and CM Punk in the ring.</p><p>Acknowledging their status as major figures in the wrestling world, McIntyre mentioned prodding at Punk and hinted at a potential showdown, stating that if Punk doesn’t crack under verbal jabs, he’s prepared to settle matters physically in the ring.</p><p>“I hope so. That’s two of our top superstars in WWE. Obviously, Cody returned to WWE a couple of years ago and had a big injury, took him out for nine months, but he has really risen to the top of the card as a crowd favorite. CM Punk is the most controversial guy in wrestling, for sure. He made his return. Seems very positive right now, the crowd is certainly very positive, he’s a huge star. I’m going to keep prodding at him and see if he cracks. Hopefully, if he doesn’t, he gets in the ring with me and I’ll physically crack him. Easy peasy.”</p><p>We will have to wait and see whether Drew McIntyre and CM Punk will be developing their feud in the coming week as we approach the Royal Rumble Premium Live Event on January 27th. Fans are certainly looking forward to them squaring off against each other at the Royal Rumble.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>What do you make of what Drew McIntyre had to say?
