We were just Christians, right? But then Prime Video does a documentary about the Duggars and Bill Gothard and your sister is in it. We had no idea!”</p><p data-characters=514 data-current-count=514 data-injectable=true>Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar were active in a faith-based organization called the Institute in Basic Life Principles (IBLP), which they promoted on their reality TV show&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">19 Kids and Counting</a>.&nbsp;The series&nbsp;fascinated audiences for ten seasons, airing from 2008 to 2015. However, the docuseries exposed the cult-like characteristics of the IBLP and how the Duggar family’s reality show became a vehicle to promote it. Now, former members are using social media to share their harrowing stories and experiences.</p><p data-characters=81 data-current-count=81 data-injectable=false>Another TikToker also realized she had been in a cult after the fact, explaining:</p><p>“It was my kids who first used the word with me a couple of years ago. I kept thinking… I was? But now I agree I was.”</p><p data-characters=102 data-current-count=322 data-injectable=false>OP’s experience resonated with a TikToker who had a similarly challenging experience growing up.</p><p>“The docuseries resurfaced a lot of childhood trauma. Definitely not an easy watch but so educational for the rest of the world.”</p><p data-characters=71 data-current-count=71 data-injectable=false>Former IBLP member Emma Tieman posted a message of solidarity and hope:</p><p>“Right there with you, sis. My family is highlighted in this, too. It blew my mind. Lots of tears. You’re not alone.”</p><p data-characters=366 data-current-count=575 data-injectable=true>Cults are harmful because they typically use different coercive tactics, such as isolating members, gaslighting, and intermittent reinforcement to manipulate and exploit them. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Steven Hassan, Ph.D.,</a> author of Freedom of Mind: Helping Loved Ones Leave Controlling People, Cults, and Beliefs, explains how to tell the difference between healthy and toxic organizations:</p><p>“Think in terms of a continuum of influence: at one end, respectful, ethical, growth-enhancing influence that recognizes the value of individuality, human rights, and creativity; at the other end, conformity, dependency, and slavery, where all authority lies with the leader and the group.”</p><p data-characters=252 data-current-count=549 data-injectable=true>The powerful impact of the docuseries is evident in the comment section of OP’s post, as viewers share how it has opened their eyes to the truth. The must-watch series has become a catalyst for reflection, thoughtful conversation, and liberation.</p><p data-characters=82 data-current-count=82 data-injectable=false>Shiny Happy People: Duggar Family Secrets&nbsp;is streaming on Amazon Prime Video.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yqecOim6esXayur8CMraZmrJieu6x51p5ksJ2imnqquoyaZJytnKl6pbvCrqSepqSWv7p50qGgp7Fdna6xvNhmp56noKGybrDUoJ6aql2brq61y7JkrJ2Tp7K1v4yrnKytnKnAbrXNZqqeqpmkwrR50Z6tnqSRqbawutJmnaiqXau2psPEq6po</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
