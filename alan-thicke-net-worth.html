He is a game show host, actor and songwriter, probably most recognised for his role in the TV series “Growing Pains”, and for his own talk shows “The Alan Thicke Show” and “Thicke of the Night”.</p><h3>Alan Thicke Net Worth $40 Million</h3><p>So how rich is Alan Thicke? Sources estimate that his current net worth is $40 million, most of his wealth having been accumulated through his involvement with television and films.</p><p>Alan Thicke attended Elliot Lake Secondary School until 1965, and then the University of Western Ontario, becoming a member of the Delta Upsilon fraternity. Alan’s career in television began in the 1970s, as a writer for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, and then as a host of the popular TV game show “First Impressions”, and a few years later “Animal Crack-Ups”, which certainly helped his net worth grow.</p><p>Alan was liked by the audience, and from then on television was always the biggest part of Thicke’s career. He was offered his own talk shows, which he hosted, produced and wrote – “The Alan Thicke Show” and “Thicke of the Night”, which significantly boosted his net worth and popularity. Even though his career began by hosting television shows, Alan gained most of his success acting in television shows, especially one situation comedy entitled “Growing Pains”. Later, Alan starred in the American TV series “Hope & Gloria” and a number of other not that well-known TV series. In 2008 he played himself in one episode of the popular TV show “How I Met your Mother”. In 2013 he participated in the reality show entitled “Celebrity Wife Swap” and in 2014 became a host of the reality show “Unusually Thicke”.</p><p>Although mostly recognised as a writer and television personality, Alan Thicke has also appeared in a number of films, including the comedy “Copper Mountain”, direct-to-video film “Stepmonster”, romantic comedy “Carolina” and crime drama “Alpha Dog”.</p><p>Another aspect of Thicke’s successful career is his work as a song composer – he is the author of the theme songs of TV series “Different Strokes” and “The Strokes of Life” as well as theme songs of game shows “The Wizard of Odds”, “Celebrity Sweepstakes” and others. During his career, he has been nominated for four Emmy awards, a Golden Globe for his performance in “Growing Pains” and a Gemini Award for his performance in “The Trial of Red Riding Hood”. Allan Thicke is a famous celebrity in Canada and it has been proven when his name has been added to the “Canada’s Walk of Fame” in 2013.</p><p>In his personal life, Alan Thicke has been married three times. Alan has two sons from his first marriage with actress Gloria Loring(1970-84), who are also famous – Robin Thiche is a singer and Brennan Thicke is an actor. He also has a son named Carter William with his second wife Gina Tolleson(1994-99). Alan married Tanya Callau in 2005. Having raised three children, Allan decided to share his wisdom of parenting with the world in the two books he published: “How Men Have Babies: The Pregnant Father’s Survival Guide” (1999) and “How to Raise Kids Who Won’t Hate you” (2006). Being a published author might have had a slight influence on his net worth.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=43.45996592845><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Alan Thicke</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$40 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>March 1, 1947</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Kirkland Lake, Canada</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>6 ft (1.854 m)</td></tr><tr readability=12><td>Profession</td><td>Actor, Songwriter, Screenwriter, Television producer, Comedian, Writer, Presenter, Master of Ceremonies, Musician, Composer</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>Elliot Lake Secondary School, University of Western Ontario</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>Canada</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Spouse</td><td>Tanya Callau (m. 2005), Gina Tolleson (m. 1994–1999), Gloria Loring (m. 1970–1983)</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Children</td><td>Robin Thicke, Brennan Thicke, Carter William Thicke</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>William Jeffrey, Joan Thicke</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Siblings</td><td>Todd Thicke, Joanne Thicke</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Nicknames</td><td>Alan Willis Jeffrey , Alan Jeffery Thicke</td></tr><tr readability=0.3265306122449><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.facebook.com/AlanThickeOffical</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.34146341463415><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.twitter.com/alan_thicke</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.4><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.instagram.com/alan_thicke</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.31111111111111><td>MySpace</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.myspace.com/actoralanthicke</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005484</a></td></tr><tr readability=11><td>Nominations</td><td>Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Musical or Comedy, Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing - Variety Series, Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy-Variety Or Music Program, Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing in a Comedy, Variety, or Music Special, Daytime...</td></tr><tr readability=21><td>Movies</td><td>The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard, Growing Pains: Return of the Seavers, Demolition High, And You Thought Your Parents Were Weird, Betrayal of the Dove, Not Quite Human, Windsor Protocol, Calendar Girl Murders, RoboDoc, Stepmonster, Alpha Dog, Raising Helen, Childstar, Casper Meets Wendy, Anarchy TV, ...</td></tr><tr readability=23><td>TV Shows</td><td>Growing Pains, Married... with Children, Thicke of the Night, Hope and Gloria, I'm in the Band, Unusually Thicke, Animal Crack-Ups, Animal Miracles, jPod, Three's a Crowd, Pictionary, Minor Adjustments, Living in TV Land, Masquerade, America 2-Night, EGG, the Arts Show, It's Our Stuff, Time for Livi...</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=21.058219178082><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=10><td>1</td><td>[on rumors he turned down the lead in "Schindler's List"]: You know, that's one of those wonderful urban myths that I never try to completely discourage, just because it's so flattering that anybody could ever believe that for a second I would turn down Steven Spielberg for a major motion picture, but that never happened.
