From Passions to Smallville to This Is Us, in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a career crossing from soap operas to superheroics</a>, Hartley has proven himself to be one of the most popular leading men on network television. And he’s at it again with CBS’ new action drama, <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tracker</a></strong>, which fans of Prime Video’s Reacher will not want to miss.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=438 data-current-count=438 data-injectable=true>Similar to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">that hit Alan Ritchson show</a> about a wandering hunk of a hero, Tracker follows Hartley’s Colter Shaw, a “lone-wolf survivalist” who travels the country making a living as a “reward seeker,” meaning that he uses his expert tracking abilities to help both citizens and law enforcement to solve all manner of mysteries. In other words, a classic yet novel format to propel the next hit network drama!</p><p data-characters=228 data-current-count=228 data-injectable=false>As based on The Never Game from best-selling author Jeffrey Deaver, and <a href=#>co-starring a talented supporting </a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">cast</a> behind Hartley, there are so many reasons to watch Tracker, and here’s how you can track it down for yourself.</p><h2 id=h-where-can-i-watch-tracker data-injectable=false>Where can I watch Tracker?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=528 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=664 data-current-count=664 data-injectable=true>Tracker is a CBS production so, in short, CBS is where you want to go to watch the show. Having the benefit of following the Super Bowl, Tracker‘s series premiere debuted on Sunday, Feb. 11, 2024, with subsequent episodes following weekly on Sundays at 9 pm ET/PT. For those who want to catch the series on streaming, thankfully you have a range of options. Various streamers offer the ability to livestream CBS, including <a href=#>Fubo</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Hulu with Live TV</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>DirecTV Stream</a>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>YouTube TV</a>. Viewers who wish to go back and watch at a later date, meanwhile, should get themselves a subscription to Paramount Plus, on which all episodes drop after they air on cable.</p><h2 id=h-how-many-episodes-are-in-tracker data-injectable=false>How many episodes are in Tracker?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Justin-Hartley-in-‘Tracker.webp><p data-characters=393 data-current-count=693 data-injectable=true>With Tracker so early into its run at the time of writing, there is currently no concrete information available regarding exactly how long its first season will be. Present listings only reach up to the fourth episode, airing March 3. Seeing as this is a network drama we’re talking about, and not some streaming miniseries, it hardly seems likely the show will wrap up in just a month.</p><p data-characters=292 data-current-count=292 data-injectable=false>It’s much more probable that Tracker will go on to have at least 13 episodes, which is typical for a mid-season series such as this. Plus, if its Super Bowl-boosted premiere is any indication, ratings should be high enough to see it get renewed for a second run for the 2024/25 season.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMSrnGabkaN6qnnWmqucoF2pv6Kvyp6pZpmemXqpu9ZmpJqmqWKysbXSqJueq12Wv6Z506Gcq51dnrtuv8SaqqimXaS7pns%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
