Directing over twenty films, his vision is something he has refused to compromise on. So it may come as a slight shock that there‚Äôs a Cronenberg movie nobody has ever seen.</p><p data-characters=316 data-current-count=659 data-injectable=true>Uploaded onto Twitter by Kevin Schofield, the internet is aghast with the stills from the never released film from the mind behind Videodrome and Scanners. Showcasing the type of intriguing body horror Cronenberg is associated with, it presents an opportunity for straight sci-fi Cronenberg never really delved into.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=de dir=ltr>David Cronenberg's Galaxy of Flesh (1985) <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Z5tBf8gXKG</a></p>‚Äî Keith Schofield (@keithscho) <a href=#>January 10, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=299 data-current-count=599 data-injectable=true>There‚Äôs one very big issue though. This film doesn‚Äôt exist, was never a project by Cronenberg, and the images shown in Schofield‚Äôs tweet were all generated by artificial intelligence. No, there is no such film called Galaxy of Flesh. Cronenberg has never had a project by the name.</p><p data-characters=298 data-current-count=298 data-injectable=false>Schofield‚Äôs use of A.I. to try and generate (and arguably intentionally mislead) images of apparent lost works of directors has caused an uproar. The music video director has not just done this for Cronenberg, but other creatives such as Michel Gondry, Andrew Lloyd Webber, and Luis Bu√±uel.</p><p data-characters=337 data-current-count=635 data-injectable=true>The reaction has not been positive. A.I.‚Äôs place in the discussion of art has been a heated one, with the general consensus being it exploits human artists, as well as detaches the humanity required to create art. Add on top of this the almost fake news layer surrounding Schofield‚Äôs tweets, and you‚Äôve got a big issue.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Congrats on stealing art to make a fake movie that looks nothing like the work of the man you‚Äôre presenting it as</p>‚Äî K-Pop David Lynch (@firagawalkwthme) <a href=#>January 11, 2023</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>At one point you have to feel ashamed for this</p>‚Äî Rol Solo (parodia del rol normal) (@rolensolitario) <a href=#>January 11, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=385 data-current-count=385 data-injectable=false>A.I. learns (and steals) visions of human creators in the eyes of many. With a tin-foil hat on, it can be seen as the attempt by corporations and billionaires to remove the need for human artists, and stop any chance of real human emotion and rebellion in art. The most aggressively negative thing you could say about A.I. art is it isn‚Äôt art. It has no place in the discussion.</p><p data-characters=140 data-current-count=525 data-injectable=true>Not just no place, but it actively seeks to undermine art and artists who historically struggle to make money from their life‚Äôs work.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=qme dir=ltr><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/4y5tXVU8Jq</a></p>‚Äî ùóòùóπùó∂ (@oldsmellysocks) <a href=#>January 11, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=377 data-current-count=677 data-injectable=true>Schofield using Cronenberg for his tweet also symbolizes a completely misunderstanding of Cronenberg‚Äôs works. His works advocate for a new understanding of the human condition, exploring the idea the human body is evolving in ways which seem confronting at first. Not just that, his work analyzes the place technology and governance actually has in controlling humanity.</p><p data-characters=145 data-current-count=145 data-injectable=false>Artificial intelligence created art feels exactly like what Cronenberg would use for an example of dystopia in a film like Crimes of the Future.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e8Bmo6iml2K5sL%2FTZpuarpmZeqS%2Bzqecp5qVp7RutM6rqaiqXZu2rbmMoZisZZKasq951KecmqqknbKlecGuq2asmJq%2Fpr%2BMmmScmaSYtXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
