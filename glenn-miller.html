He was one of the most popular bandleaders in the late 1930s and early 1940s with such songs as "Moonlight Serenade" and "Tuxedo Junction." In 1942, Miller enlisted in the U.S. Army and was assigned to lead the Army Air Force Band. He boosted the morale of the troops with his many popular songs before mysteriously disappearing on a flight from England to Paris, France. Miller's original recordings continue to sell millions of copies.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Born in Clarinda, Iowa, on March 1, 1904, bandleader and musician Glenn Miller started out playing the mandolin as a child, but quickly switched to the horn. His family moved several times in his youth â€” to Missouri, then to Nebraska, and finally to Colorado in 1918. In high school in Fort Morgan, Colorado, Miller played in the school band. He turned professional after graduating in 1921, becoming a member of Boyd Senter's orchestra.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1923, Miller quit the orchestra to go to college. He spent a year at the University of Colorado before dropping out to return to the music business. Moving to Los Angeles, California, Miller worked with Ben Pollack's band for a time. He then headed to New York City, where he freelanced as a trombonist and an arranger. In 1934, Miller became the musical director for Tommy Dorsey's band with brother Jimmy Dorsey. He then formed an American orchestra for British bandleader Ray Noble.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">King of Swing</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While he first recorded under his own name in 1935, Miller struggled for several years before establishing himself as a musician and bandleader. He formed his own orchestra and then reconfigured it several times until he found the winning combination. It was his band's gig at the famed Glen Island Casino in New Rochelle, New York, in 1939 that helped put Miller on the map. Their performances there were broadcast on the radio, giving them great public exposure.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Miller scored his first hit with "Wishing (Will Make It So)" that same year. He penned his even bigger successful single, "Moonlight Serenade," which climbed the charts in 1939 as well. With their distinctive swing jazz style, Miller and his orchestra became the country's top dance band. They dominated the music charts with such tracks as "In the Mood," "Tuxedo Junction" and "Pennsylvania 6-5000" in 1940.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1941, Miller made his first film, Sun Valley Serenade, with Sonja Henie. The film featured another one of his signature songs "Chattanooga Choo Choo." The following year, he appeared in Orchestra Wives (1942). That same year, Miller had to put his successful music career aside to serve his country. He was inducted into the U.S. Army, later transferring to the Army Air Force.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Mysterious Death</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Miller headed up the U.S. Army Air Force Band, which gave numerous performances to entertain the troops during World War II. He was stationed in England in 1944 when he learned that his band was to go to Paris. On December 15, Miller boarded a transport plane headed to the newly liberated French capital. He intended to make preparations for his group's new series of concerts there, but he never arrived.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">What happened to Miller's plane remains a mystery. Neither the plane nor Miller's body was ever recovered. He left his wife Helen and their two children. Miller's military band continued to play for months after his death, and the Glenn Miller Orchestra was revived after the war to honor his legacy. Collections of his greatest hits did well on the charts for several years after his passing as well. Jimmy Stewart later starred in the popular film The Glenn Miller Story (1954), which was loosely based on Miller's life.</p><ul data-node-id=20 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Birth Year: 1904</li><li>Birth date: March 1, 1904</li><li>Birth State: Iowa</li><li>Birth City: Clarinda</li><li>Birth Country: United States</li><li>Gender: Male</li><li>Best Known For: Bandleader Glenn Miller inspired the World War II generation and boosted morale with many popular songs.</li><li>Industries</li><li>Astrological Sign: Pisces</li><li>Schools</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>University of Colorado</li></ul><li>Death Year: 1944</li><li>Death date: December 15, 1944</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><br data-node-id=23><ul data-node-id=25 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Glenn Miller Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/musicians/glenn-miller</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: September 3, 2020</li><li>Original Published Date: April 2, 2014</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGikrquZmLaiutJonqWdnqN6rrXLpZyr</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
