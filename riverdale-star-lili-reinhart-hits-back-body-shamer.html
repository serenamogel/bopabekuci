News</a>) that's since been deleted, someone told the actress, "I just don't want your talent to be overshadowed by your weight."</p><p>Rude.</p><p>But luckily, Reinhart was ready with just the right thing to say. "Thank you so much for being concerned about my weight," she <a href=#>replied</a> on May 3, 2017. "I'll respond later after I finish my double cheeseburger."</p><p>She also hit back the next day while live-tweeting during the season's penultimate episode. "You can't eat Taco Bell if you're an actress on the CW," the 20-year-old <a href=#>wrote</a>, alongside a GIF of her character saying, "I don't think so."</p><p>Reinhart also reacted to getting body shamed on <a href=#>Instagram Stories</a> (via E! News), filming a video of herself in her car. "So today basically I was fat-shamed on Twitter, that's what it's called, and my response is basically, don't let anyone f***ing tell you what you can and can't eat," she told her followers.</p><p>She also added a little message for her Twitter hater. "Kiss my ass, because I love my Taco Bell, bitch," Reinhart said, taking a bite out of a burrito.</p><p>She couldn't have handled the situation more perfectly.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmb2tgboBwvsivnKuckaGybr%2FTmqlmpJmhtm6%2BxKKloZmiqXqptdOsZJuZk6B6o7vDsmSsoJGisrN7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
