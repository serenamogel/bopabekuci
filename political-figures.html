Inspired by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activists/martin-luther-king-jr data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Martin Luther King Jr." class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Martin Luther King Jr.</a>, he joined the burgeoning <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.history.com/topics/black-history/civil-rights-movement data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="civil rights movement" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">civil rights movement</a>. Lewis was a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.history.com/topics/black-history/freedom-rides data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Freedom Rider" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Freedom Rider</a>, spoke at 1963's <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.history.com/topics/black-history/march-on-washington data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="March on Washington" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">March on Washington</a> and led the demonstration that became known as "Bloody Sunday." He was elected to Congress in 1986 and received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2011.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">John Robert Lewis was born outside of Troy, Alabama, on February 21, 1940. Lewis had a happy childhood — though he needed to work hard to assist his sharecropper parents — but he chafed against the unfairness of segregation. He was particularly disappointed when the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.history.com/topics/supreme-court-facts data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Supreme Court" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Supreme Court</a> ruling in 1954's <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.history.com/topics/black-history/brown-v-board-of-education-of-topeka data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Brown v. The Board of Education" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Brown v. The Board of Education</a> didn't affect his school life. However, hearing King's sermons and news of the 1955-56 <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.history.com/topics/black-history/montgomery-bus-boycott data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Montgomery bus boycott" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Montgomery bus boycott</a> inspired Lewis to act for the changes he wanted to see.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Civil Rights Struggle</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1957, Lewis left Alabama to attend the American Baptist Theological Seminary in Nashville, Tennessee. There, he learned about nonviolent protest and helped to organize sit-ins at segregated lunch counters. He was arrested during these demonstrations, which upset his mother, but Lewis was committed to the civil rights movement and went on to participate in the Freedom Rides of 1961.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Freedom Riders challenged the segregated facilities they encountered at interstate bus terminals in the South, which had been deemed illegal by the Supreme Court. It was dangerous work that resulted in arrests and beatings for many involved, including Lewis.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1963, Lewis became chairman of the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.history.com/topics/black-history/sncc data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee</a>. That same year, as one of the "Big Six" leaders of the civil rights movement, he helped plan the March on Washington. Lewis — the youngest speaker at the event — had to alter his speech in order to please other organizers, but still delivered a powerful oration that declared, "We all recognize the fact that if any radical social, political and economic changes are to take place in our society, the people, the masses, must bring them about."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After the March on Washington, in 1964, the Civil Rights Act became law. However, this did not make it easier for African Americans to vote in the South. To bring attention to this struggle, Lewis and Hosea Williams led a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.history.com/topics/black-history/selma-montgomery-march data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="march from Selma to Montgomery" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">march from Selma to Montgomery</a>, Alabama, on March 7, 1965. After crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge, the marchers were attacked by state troopers. Lewis was severely beaten once more, this time suffering a fractured skull.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The violent attacks were recorded and disseminated throughout the country, and the images proved too powerful to ignore. "<a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/news/selma-bloody-sunday-attack-civil-rights-movement data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Bloody Sunday" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Bloody Sunday</a>," as the day was labeled, sped up the passage of <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/voting-rights-act data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="1965's Voting Rights Act" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">1965's Voting Rights Act</a>.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">U.S. Congressman</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Lewis left the SNCC in 1966. Though devastated by the assassinations of King and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/robert-kennedy data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Robert Kennedy" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Robert Kennedy</a> in 1968, Lewis continued his work to enfranchise minorities. In 1970, he became director of the Voter Education Project. During his tenure, the VEP helped to register millions of minority voters.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Lewis ran for office himself in 1981, winning a seat on the Atlanta City Council. In 1986, he was elected to the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.history.com/topics/history-of-the-house-of-representatives data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="House of Representatives" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">House of Representatives</a>. Representing Georgia's 5th District, he was one of the most respected members of Congress. Since entering office, he has called for healthcare reform, measures to fight poverty and improvements in education. Most importantly, he oversaw multiple renewals of the Voting Rights Act. When the Supreme Court struck down part of the law in 2013's Shelby County v. Holder, Lewis decried the decision as a "dagger into the heart" of voting rights.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In the wake of the mass shooting that took place on June 12, 2016, in Orlando, Florida, Lewis led a sit-in comprised of approximately 40 House Democrats on the floor of the House of Representatives on June 22nd in an attempt to bring attention and force Congress to address gun violence by taking definitive legislative action. “We have been too quiet for too long,” Lewis said. “There comes a time when you have to say something. You have to make a little noise. You have to move your feet. This is the time.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The protest came just days after several measures including a bill regarding background checks and adding restrictions on the purchase of guns by people on the federal no-fly list, failed in the Senate. Senator Chris Murphy applauded the protest. Murphy had previously led a filibuster in the Senate which led to the subsequent vote.</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Clashing With Donald Trump</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Lewis also spoke out against the presidency of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/donald-trump data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Donald Trump" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Donald Trump</a>, who was elected on November 8, 2016. In an interview with Chuck Todd for NBC News’ Meet the Press, which aired on January 15, 2017, Lewis said he didn’t believe Trump was a “legitimate president” because of Russian interference in the election. “I think the Russians participated in helping this man get elected and they helped destroy the candidacy of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/hillary-clinton data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Hillary Clinton" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Hillary Clinton</a>,” Lewis said in the interview. He also said he would not attend Trump’s inauguration.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Trump responded on Twitter, criticizing Lewis’ work as a congressman and tweeting that Lewis was “All talk, talk, talk - no action or results. Sad!” The president-elect's attack on Lewis came just days before the Martin Luther King holiday, and prompted vocal support of the civil rights icon across social media. Several Democratic lawmakers also joined in support of Lewis and boycotted Trump’s inauguration.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Trump continued his war of words, tweeting: “John Lewis said about my inauguration, ‘It will be the first one that I've missed.’ WRONG (or lie)! He boycotted Bush 43 also because he...thought it would be hypocritical to attend Bush's swearing-in....he doesn't believe Bush is the true elected president. Sound familiar!”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">A spokeswoman for Lewis confirmed that he had missed the inauguration of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/george-w-bush data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="George W. Bush" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">George W. Bush</a>: "His absence at that time was also a form of dissent. He did not believe the outcome of that election, including the controversies around the results in Florida and the unprecedented intervention of the U.S. Supreme Court, reflected a free, fair and open democratic process.”</p><img alt="Leaders of March on Washington: Joachim Prinz, Eugene Carson Blake, Martin Luther King Jr., Floyd McKissick, Matthew Ahmann & John Lewis" title="Leaders of March on Washington: Joachim Prinz, Eugene Carson Blake, Martin Luther King Jr., Floyd McKissick, Matthew Ahmann & John Lewis" width=8734 height=5591 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-50702738.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Photo: Robert W.

After <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/barack-obama data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Barack Obama" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Barack Obama</a> won the presidency in 2008, Lewis stated that "When we were organizing voter-registration drives, going on the Freedom Rides, sitting in, coming here to Washington for the first time, getting arrested, going to jail, being beaten, I never thought — I never dreamed — of the possibility that an African American would one day be elected president of the United States."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In addition to his work in Congress, Lewis reached a younger generation by helping to create a series of graphic novels about his work in the civil rights movement. In 2016, he won the National Book Award for the third installment in the series March: Book Three, which marks the first time a graphic novel has received the honor.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">He accepted the award with co-writer Andrew Aydin and illustrator Nate Powell and spoke of its significance in an emotional acceptance speech. “Some of you know I grew up in rural Alabama, very poor, very few books in our home,” Lewis said. “I remember in 1956, when I was 16 years old, going to the public library to get library cards, and we were told the library was for whites only and not for coloreds. And to come here and receive this honor, it’s too much.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">He also spoke about the importance of books in his life. “I had a wonderful teacher in elementary school who told me: ‘Read, my child, read’, and I tried to read everything," he said. "I love books.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The civil rights icon has also been honored with numerous awards, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the NAACP's Spingarn Medal and the sole <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/john-f-kennedy data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="John F.

Don't get in the way.' I got in trouble. I got in the way. It was necessary trouble.</li><li>Second-class citizenship is not citizenship at all.</li><li>Courage is a reflection of the heart—it is a reflection of something deep within the man or woman or even a child who must resist and must defy an authority that is morally wrong. Courage makes us march on despite fear and doubt on the road toward justice. Courage is not heroic but as necessary as birds need wings to fly. Courage is not rooted in reason but rather Courage comes from a divine purpose to make things right.</li><li>People around the world will not be inspired by our missiles and our guns; they will be inspired by our ideas.</li><li>I have not accomplished everything I wanted to. I would like to, before I leave this little piece of real estate, do a little more for the cause of peace. To end the violence here at home and violence abroad. We spend so much of our resources killing each other.</li><li>We were determined not to let any act of violence keep us from our goal. We knew our lives could be threatened, but we had made up our minds not to turn back.</li><li>When Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, he helped free and liberate all of us.</li><li>I disagree with the court that the history of discrimination is somehow irrelevant today. The record clearly demonstrates numerous attempts to impede voting rights still exist, and it does not matter that those attempts are not as 'pervasive, widespread or rampant' as they were in 1965. One instance of discrimination is too much in a democracy.</li><li>Imagine that. I was beaten near to death at the Rock Hill Greyhound bus terminal during the Freedom Rides in 1961. Now the police chief is Black.</li><li>We all recognize the fact that if any radical social, political and economic changes are to take place in our society, the people, the masses, must bring them about. In the struggle, we must seek more than civil rights; we must work for the community of love, peace and true brotherhood. Our minds, souls and hearts cannot rest until freedom and justice exist for all people.</li><li>I believe in nonviolence as a way of life, as a way of living. I believe that this idea is one of those immutable principles that is nonnegotiable if you're going to create a world community at peace with itself.</li><li>I know maybe it won't happen in my lifetime, but I know somehow in some way we're going to create the Beloved Community, that we're going to create a national community, a world community that is at peace.</li><li>When we were organizing voter-registration drives, going on the Freedom Rides, sitting in, coming here to Washington for the first time, getting arrested, going to jail, being beaten, I never thought—I never dreamed—of the possibility that an African American would one day be elected president of the United States.</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGinqKSZqbakrctmnaKfpaeytHvJqJ%2BnZZyaxKq%2F</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
