That's level one. Why not something about the way the movie extended silence as far as it could go? His parting scene with his wife (<a href=#>Denise Richards</a>), who is being kept alive by the truck that has her pinned to a tree, is agonizingly labored.</p><p>"The Ring" material is barely different from "The Ring" itself; pop in the cassette, answer the phone, be doomed to die. "The Sixth Sense" stuff is funnier, as a psychic little kid walks through the movie relentlessly predicting everyone's secrets. Funny, but it doesn't build. Then there's an unpleasant scene at the home of news reader Cindy Campbell (<a href=#>Anna Faris</a>), involving a salivating priest who arrives to be a babysitter for her young son (ho, ho).</p><p>The movie is filled with famous and semi-famous faces, although only two of them work for their laughs and get them. That would be in the pre-opening credits, where <a href=#>Jenny McCarthy</a> and <a href=#>Pamela Anderson</a> take the dumb blond shtick about as far as it can possibly go, while their push-up bras do the same thing in another department.</p><p>Other cameos: <a href=#>Queen Latifah</a>, <a href=#>Eddie Griffin</a>, <a href=#>William Forsythe</a>, <a href=#>Peter Boyle</a>, <a href=#>Macy Gray</a>, <a href=#>George Carlin</a>, <a href=#>Ja Rule</a>, Master P, and <a href=#>Leslie Nielsen</a>, the Olivier of spoofs, playing the President. But to what avail? The movie has been directed by <a href=#>David Zucker</a>, who with his brother Jerry and <a href=#>Jim Abrahams</a> more or less invented the genre with the brilliant "<a href=#>Airplane!</a>" (1980). Maybe the problem isn't with him. Maybe the problem is that the genre is over and done with and dead. "<a href=#>Scream</a>" seemed to point in a new and funnier direction -- the smart satire -- but "Scary Movie 3" points right back again. It's like it has its own crop circle, with its own arrow pointing right at itself.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46smpqqqWK6sMLInmRsZWJlfXQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
