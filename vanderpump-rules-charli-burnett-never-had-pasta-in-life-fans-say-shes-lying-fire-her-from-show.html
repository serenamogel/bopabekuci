We had another pasta moment on the latest episode of the ‘Vanderpump Rules’. By now everybody knows how much the cast members of the show love pasta, so when the two new servers of SUR restaurant- Charli Burnett and Dayna Kathan were engaging in a casual conversation, the topic of the infamous pasta inevitably pops up.<br>&nbsp;<br>We hear Dayna raving about the pasta she has been having for lunch every day at the restaurant and then proceeds to ask Charli which pasta she likes on the menu. Charli then explains to Dayna that she never had pasta in her life because according to her she has a theory that people get fat due to pasta. Dayna and the fans were left shell shocked with Charli’s reasons for never having had pasta.</p><p>Fans instantly took social media to express their disbelief. A fan tweeted, “How does someone not have had pasta ever in their life?? Like you’re telling me that you were on a diet when you were a toddler ?! #PumpRules.” Another fan shared, “Omg. Who has never had pasta? I’m done already. #itsnotaboutthepasta #PumpRules.” “This girl saying she’s never eaten pasta, along with her explanation for doing so, broke my brain #PumpRules,” commented a fan.<br>&nbsp;<br>Few fans are convinced that Charli might be lying about never having pasta in her life. A fan wrote, “I don’t believe that girl has never had pasta. It’s a lie. Like even when she was 10? At what age did she come up with her genius theory? #PumpRules #VanderpumpRules #BravoTV.” “Never had pasta? I call TOTAL BULLSHIT. new girl charli has NEVER HAD PASTA IN HER LIFE? what kind of LA bullshit is that? #PumpRules,” questioned an annoyed fan.&nbsp;</p><p>Considering how integral pasta has become to the show, fans began demanding that she be fired from the show for saying she doesn’t eat pasta. A fan demanded, “Lisa needs to fire this random girl immediately for saying she’s never eaten pasta before in her life 🤮 #PumpRules.” Another fan echoed similar thoughts with, “When the new girl says she’s never had pasta bc she thinks pasta makes you gain weight.. please leave the show now #PumpRules.”<br>&nbsp;<br>You can tune in to new episodes of ‘Vanderpump Rules’ Season 8, every Tuesday at 9/8c.<br>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRorpGjsaa%2Bz66kqWWiqrmmv4ycn5qqnJ56o8HRp5ytrF2jsrex0Wafmpxdpa60wMBmoKdlnJ6zpnnFmqWsZaOWxm6%2Fx56qZqSpnruoecWiqZ5lmJq%2FbrLRqKRmq5ikxA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
