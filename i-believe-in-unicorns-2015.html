Bring on adulthood because adolescence with its sick mothers and abusive fathers has been awful. And so they race, head first, into the unknown world, turning a large portion of “I Believe in Unicorns” into a road movie. Meyerhoff expertly recognizes that just because Davina and Sterling <i>want</i> to be grown-ups doesn’t mean that they are yet. Having sex doesn’t make you an instant adult. And so they play games in convenience stores and get into childish fights, which quickly become less childish as they realize there’s no greener grass on the other side of the fence. Not knowing where you’re going in this world can quickly go from liberating to boring, especially when you’re on the journey with someone you don’t really know.</p><p>Meyerhoff isn’t the only name to remember from “I Believe in Unicorns,” as the film simply wouldn’t work at all without the committed, fantastic performance of Natalie Dyer. She balances the innocence and desire of her character in perfectly equal measures, sketching a person in that dangerous part of life in which they are not a child and yet also not quite yet a woman. She holds every scene, adding emotional weight to clichés that would have been paper-thin without her work.</p><p>“I Believe in Unicorns” sometimes gets a bit too Film School Project and doesn’t quite fill out a feature film (it’s not even 80 minutes with long credits on both sides) but it works on its own terms. Most of all, it is an introduction to two people I hope to see in the next festival line-up I receive: Leah Meyerhoff and Natalie Dyer.</p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46iZJudnJ6yt7GMoqVmrZ6esLC%2Bzaxka2hhag%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
