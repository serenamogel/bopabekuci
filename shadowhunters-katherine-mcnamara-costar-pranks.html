When they’re not busy shooting scenes for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>the Freeform series</a>—which wraps its first season tonight at 9 p.m. ET—the co-stars have a habit of playing elaborate pranks on each other. And according to Katherine McNamara, who plays human-angel hybrid Clary Fray on the show, one cast member in particular is usually the culprit: Dominic Sherwood.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Dom is quite the prankster,” McNamara recently told InStyle. “And I am more often than not the prankee.” Just last week, the 20-year-old actress shared an Instagram video that shows Sherwood—who plays McNamara’s love interest Jace Wayland on the show and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>is dating </a>Modern Family star <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Sarah Hyland</a> IRL—jump out and try to scare her on the show’s set. <strong>Watch it here:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But compared to some of Sherwood’s past tricks, that one looks harmless. “The craziest prank was probably the day he decided to tape me to my trailer,” McNamara said. “Everyone came running with cameras to document the humiliation, and then Matthew Daddario—being the big brother that he is—came to cut me out. So despite Dom’s efforts, I still made it to set on time.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jokes aside, McNamara enjoys having her “big brothers” on set. “It makes everything a lot of fun,” she said. But while she may treat them like her silly older siblings off-camera, things get steamy onscreen. “One of my favorite things about the show is all of the relationships,” said McNamara. “There’s no straight path for any character, especially when it comes to the love triangle between Clary, Jace, and Simon Lewis [played by Alberto Rosende].”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to McNamara, Clary’s feelings for both guys reflect a deeper internal struggle. “I love that Clary can never truly choose between the two of them, because each one represents half of who she is,” she said. “Jace represents her Shadowhunter side, and she needs him to teach her and help her navigate this new world. But then Simon represents her humanity, and he knows her better than she knows herself. He’s there for her, he’s her rock and her stability, and he’s the person that keeps her sane throughout all of this. So in trying to choose between the two of them, Clary is really trying to choose half of herself—and that is nearly impossible.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>© 2015 Disney Enterprises, Inc.

And so they did.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The season finale of Shadowhunters airs Tuesday, April 5, at 9 p.m. ET on Freeform.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGejna6lu9ahrKeslafAbrfArZ%2Beqpmjsm65wqeYppmilnqku9KtmKtloKeur7fS</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
