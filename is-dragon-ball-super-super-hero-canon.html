Having done one film set in the canon, you may be wondering about the latest Dragon Ball Super film.</p><p data-characters=101 data-current-count=363 data-injectable=false>So, here’s everything you need to know about the canonical status of Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero.</p><h2 id=h-is-dragon-ball-super-super-hero-canon data-injectable=false>Is Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero canon?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/DBSSH-2.png><p data-characters=109 data-current-count=109 data-injectable=false>While it would seem that <strong>yes, Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero</strong> is canon to the anime, things aren’t so simple.</p><p data-characters=250 data-current-count=359 data-injectable=false>Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero is a direct follow-up to the events of Dragon Ball Super: Broly, which became the first canonical film in the Dragon Ball franchise. This being the case, it would only make sense that Super Hero is also considered canon.</p><p data-characters=205 data-current-count=564 data-injectable=true>However, things get confusing — during a recent interview with Shueisha’s V-Jump magazine, Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero producer Akio Iyoku detailed where the movie fits alongside the manga canon.</p><p data-characters=184 data-current-count=184 data-injectable=false>In this interview, he explained that the film shows a parallel storyline taking place at the same time as Toyotaro’s manga series. The interview was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">translated and shared on Twitter</a>.</p><p>“Between this film and Toyotarou-sensei’s manga, we currently have two lines of Dragon Ball Super running. To begin with, the film is written purely as a sequel to Dragon Ball Super: Broly. We wanted to pick up on and meet the expectations of everyone who’s stuck with Dragon Ball so far, along the lines of, “It’d be neat this happened,” or “I hope this kind of character shows up.”</p><p>And in [V-Jump‘s] pages, we have the continuing story of Goku and Vegeta. We’ll see new strong enemies show up, and new stories, and events will continue to progress. Of course Toriyama diligently oversees the storylines for the manga too, so it’s like we have events running in parallel. In terms of timeline placement, we try to not build things in too strictly — we’d like to leave margins in the story, to allow for a greater degree of freedom.”</p><p data-characters=108 data-current-count=108 data-injectable=false>This would seem to indicate a departure from the manga canon, but right now it isn’t entirely clear.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=261 data-current-count=369 data-injectable=false>If this is the case, it remains to be seen how the manga and a potential second season of the anime will treat the character progression that has taken place during the film. Once this is addressed, we should have a clearer picture of how the two are connected.</p><p data-characters=156 data-current-count=525 data-injectable=false>In the meantime, the next Dragon Ball movie is apparently in the developmental stages, with the project potentially set to release sometime in 2024 or 2025.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6iqmacopa0sLqMm5ilpF2owrGx0WaqrqiVp3qpsdGoZJyZnqS7cA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
