It’s a good idea to use Same Type Attack Bonuses (STAB), which occur when a Pokemon uses a move of the same type as it.</p><p>Incarnate Thundurus’ optimal moveset has a lot to recommend it. Trainers will want to use Thunder Shock and Thunder Punch as the Pokemon’s primary moveset for the most part. This is due to the fact that both moves grant STAB, and Thunder Punch is a reliable Charge Move. It doesn’t deliver as much damage as Thunder, but its energy economy is significantly superior.</p><p>Because Incarnate Thundurus lacks defense and endurance, it’s better to use speedier Charge Moves rather than harder-hitting ones.</p><p>Crunch is a good choice for trainers looking to offer Incarnate Thundurus a secondary Charge Move.</p><p>While Thunder is a powerful move that does a lot of damage, the Pokemon may not have enough time to replenish its energy reserves. Furthermore, it is an Electric-type move, and if trainers are already employing Thunder Punch, the Legendary Pokemon’s type efficacy is reduced.</p><p>Crunch should give Incarnate Thundurus a lot more options when it comes to fighting Psychic-type Pokemon. When utilizing moves that match its own types, this provides it a subtle usefulness that it wouldn’t have otherwise.</p><p>Thundurus’ Pokemon GO moveset in this form isn’t the best, and trainers are more likely to prefer its Therian Forme.
