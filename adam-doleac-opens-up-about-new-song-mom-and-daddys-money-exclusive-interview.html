This song is my way of saying thank you to them. One day, when it’s my turn to raise my own, I hope I can do it as well as they did.”</p><p>CS Country caught up with Doleac during the&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>2018 CMA Music Festival&nbsp;</strong></a>in Nashville last month, where he talked all about his new song “Mom and Daddy’s Money” and the new music he’s been working on.</p><p>Check out the full Q&A below and make sure to give Adam a follow on Instagram at <a href=#>@adamdoleac</a></p><p><strong>CS Country: You just released “Mom and Daddy’s Money!” Can you tell us the writing process behind that and what the song means to you?</strong></p><p><strong>Adam Doleac:</strong> “That song means a lot to me! As a songwriter, you want to try and tell your own story when you’re writing a song, and that song is very much me. I think that as a kid the best thing you can have is two good parents, especially in the world we live in today. Having that and someone to help build you into the person you are today is a very lucky thing to have. I had that, and I still do! Writing that song, it was kind of easy in the sense that I wrote down how it felt to have such a gift like that. It was a really cool moment getting to show mom and dad that song. Mom cried for an hour or so. It was a really good chance for me to connect with my fans in a more personal way and so far I think everyone has been loving it!”</p><p><strong>CS Country: What is the biggest compliment you’ve gotten from that release?</strong></p><p><strong>Adam Doleac:</strong> “I think when people, kids or the parents, come up to me after shows and tell me they have to send it right to their parent or child. That is the best compliment I can get, knowing that it can relate to them in the way that it does to me is really special.”</p><p><strong>CS Country: You wrote Darius Rucker’s “Don’t!” How has it been seeing him perform that?</strong></p><p><strong>Adam Doleac:</strong> “I grew up listening to <strong>Hootie and the Blowfish</strong> so hearing that for the first time was really cool. The coolest thing is that I’ll get videos from like Australia or all around the world or <strong>Darius</strong> playing “Don’t.” He’s played it every live show for awhile, I actually got to go see him last night at CMA Fest! Getting a cut with anybody is great, but having one of your idols cut one of your songs is pretty unbelievable.”</p><p><strong>CS Country: What are you most excited for this CMA Fest?</strong></p><p><strong>Adam Doleac:</strong> “I would say tomorrow! I am playing the Chevy Breakout Stage and this is my first year getting to play a big stage like that at CMA Fest. Looking on the schedule over 2,000 people have checked in! Going to have a great crowd, going to have a great time!”</p><p><strong>CS Country: What else can we expect to see from you in 2018?</strong></p><p><strong>Adam Doleac:</strong> “Some more new music, we are doing a lot of touring this summer. We’re doing shows with <strong>Kane Brown</strong>,<strong> Florida Georgia Line</strong>, <strong>Chris Young</strong> and a couple others. I would say most importantly new music.”</p><p><strong>CS Country: Over the past year and a half to two years, you have grown exponentially as an artist! How do you stay grounded?</strong></p><p><strong>Adam Doleac:</strong> “I keep myself grounded pretty well. I have “never enough, not good enough” disease so I’m always working and working and working. Our team has been doing a great job, it’s a long journey but luckily for us it keeps going up and up and up. Just today we had two autograph signings and I got there and there was a line wrapped around the booth! Last year there would’ve been nobody. It has been really cool to watch that grow, hopefully it keeps going!”</p><p><strong>CS Country: Since we are Celeb Secrets Country, what is a secret about yourself?</strong></p><p><strong>Adam Doleac:</strong> “I write songs pretty much every single day. After every time I write a song, I have a typewriter in my house and I come back home and I’ll type the whole song out on a typewriter and then I document them all in actual typewriter font. So all the promotions I do on typewriters and all of that is from my actual typewriter.”</p><span class=ppma-layout-prefix></span><ul class=pp-multiple-authors-boxes-ul><li class="pp-multiple-authors-boxes-li author_index_0 author_isabel has-avatar"><img data-expand=600 alt="Isabel Baldinger" src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/379a1685c092463159cb8b7c4396694d?s=80&d=mm&r=g" http viewbox height=80 width=80 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="pp-author-boxes-description multiple-authors-description">Isabel is an intern for Celeb Secrets Country.
