Aljamain Sterling, who had already secured three defenses of his bantamweight belt, aimed to make it four with a victory over O’Malley. However, the outcome of the fight defied all predictions.</p><p>O’Malley executed a right-hand counter as Sterling over-extended on a punch, causing Sterling to drop immediately. O’Malley then finished the fight with precise ground strikes.<a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9> This victory sent shockwaves through the MMA world</a>, as nobody anticipated O’Malley defeating Aljamain in such a manner.</p><p>During a recent interview with Ariel Helwani on the MMA Hour, O’Malley revealed that his journey to this remarkable victory was filled with challenges, starting long before the fight night itself.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Sean O’Malley reveals he wasn’t at 100% for the Aljamain Sterling fight</h2><p>Ariel Helwani inquired about O’Malley’s training camp and mentioned that his <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>head coach and friend, Tim Welch,</a> had described it as one of his worst due to injuries.</p><p>O’Malley shared “This fight camp, in his eyes (Welch), it was really really bad because we couldn’t grapple for six weeks, literally six weeks to the day I had that muscle strain injury in my rib and so for him, being the head coach, wanting to like kind of structure practices like we couldn’t even clinch.”</p><p>This situation was far from ideal for his preparations. But O’Malley said he adapted by focusing on mitt work, aerodyne, and kickboxing. However, he couldn’t engage in MMA training, wrestling, or jiu-jitsu. Despite these challenges, he adjusted his game plan to prioritize avoiding takedowns due to the injury.</p><p>This adaptability paid off during the fight, as Aljamain Sterling failed to secure a single takedown against O’Malley. Looking ahead, fans are speculating about O’Malley’s next opponent, with names like Merab Dvalishvili and<a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9> Marlon Vera</a> in the mix.</p><p>Regardless of his next challenge, Sean O’Malley has proven himself as a formidable bantamweight. And that he has come a long way since his Contender Series days.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>The rise of ‘The Sugar Show’</h2><p>O’Malley first gained attention when he made his debut during <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Dana White’s Contender Series</a> in 2017. Standing tall and rangy for a bantamweight, O’Malley showcased his slick movement and precise striking. Culminating in a memorable knockout of Alfred Khashakyan during the Contender Series. He continued his momentum with a walk-away KO of Eddie Wineland at UFC 250, securing the victory in under two minutes of the first round.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-1328074129.jpg><p>However, O’Malley’s most significant win before claiming the bantamweight title <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>was a controversial one against</a> <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Petr Yan</a> at UFC 280.&nbsp;In a hard-fought battle against Yan, O’Malley displayed his skills. Hurting Yan in the first round and opening a cut with a step-in knee in the third round. Despite Yan’s efforts, O’Malley emerged victorious via split decision.</p><p>Now, as the UFC bantamweight champion, Sean O’Malley’s future remains uncertain. But he has silenced his doubters and established himself as one of the top bantamweights in the world.
