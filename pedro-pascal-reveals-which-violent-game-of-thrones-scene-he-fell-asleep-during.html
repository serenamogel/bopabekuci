He’s been on the media circuit non-stop, but perhaps one of the most hotly (no pun intended) anticipated appearances he’s made is on First We Feast’s Hot Ones.</p><p>The former Game of Thrones star appeared on the YouTube series in which celebrities give an interview while eating increasingly spicy chicken wings, and during his stint on the show, Pascal revealed that he more or less fell asleep while shooting his iconic death scene.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=248 data-current-count=548 data-injectable=true>Already visibly sweating about one-third of the way through a nearly 30-minute interview, Pascal recalls shooting the moment at which Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson’s character “The Mountain” crushes his skull as “the best part of the day.”</p><p data-characters=350 data-current-count=350 data-injectable=false>He talks about how the cool, fake blood pouring onto his face from tubes attached to Björnsson’s arms on a very hot shooting day, on top of the fleshy prosthetic gore on his face, managed to lull him into a deep sleep. The star then mused about how he is generally not a great sleeper and about what it takes to actually get him to doze off:&nbsp;</p><p>“It was very cathartic and I went into the deepest sleep I’ve been in. I realize now that, cause I’m not a very good sleeper, I need to be [covered] with pieces of flesh, gelatinous, cool to the touch “face meat,” and pooling blood and maybe I’ll finally get a good f****** night’s sleep.”</p><p data-characters=286 data-current-count=286 data-injectable=false>This isn’t the first time Pascal has been open about his troubles with sleep, having revealed in a past interview on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Tonight Show</a> that he forgot about a conversation with The Last of Us showrunners about landing the role of Joel in the now-hit series after taking a sleeping pill.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yxscOrpmaokaiworiMq5yvnZGhwG7Dx6KaoWWmnrytsc2tZKCZnZp6sLKMrZ%2Brp56awG6%2Fwp6lnmWYmnqnsculZJqrnJqysXnDrqmippdk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
