His new green blasts, explained</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p data-characters=327 data-injectable=true data-video=true>Heroes and villains in the MCU are usually pretty easy to tell apart, so it’s no wonder the ones that are a bit more complicated wind up being massive fan favorites. The universal adoration (and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sky-high viewing figures</a>) indicate that Tom Hiddleston’s charismatic God of Mischief <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Loki</a></strong> might just be top of the pile.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=604 data-current-count=604 data-injectable=true>His family history is thorny, to say the least, and his back-and-forth between good and evil is fascinating and always surprising. Like everything in Loki’s character, his powers are also multi-faceted and chaotic. He can basically do a bit of everything, combining his natural frost giant superhuman strength, agility, durability, and cryokinesis (ice manipulation), <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">with the magic he learned from his mother, Frigga</a>. As the God of Mischief, Loki is also known for being a cunning trickster and master of manipulation and illusion, skills he mastered as a child in order to taunt his brother Thor.</p><p data-characters=425 data-current-count=425 data-injectable=true>While he can tap into all kinds of magic powers, Loki’s speciality is deceit. In fact, he’s almost as skilled at tricking people with his words and emotions as with magical illusions. But, while most of this was known to all of us Marvel Cinematic Universe fans, Disney Plus’ Loki introduced some interesting new powers that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">would have surely come in handy for the mischievous Asgardian in previous outings</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-does-loki-have-new-powers-in-the-disney-plus-show data-injectable=false>Does Loki have new powers in the Disney Plus show?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/chrome_pzbw9PAaYY.jpg><p data-characters=550 data-current-count=850 data-injectable=true>Well, the short answer is yes. It seems meeting his many variants has helped Loki develop new untapped abilities. Specifically, the demi-god can now blast powerful green energy similar to what the Scarlet Witch can do (only hers is, you know, red). In the second episode of Loki’s second season we see how, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">when paired with Sylvie</a>, their combined blasts can knock several people down. It appears that this energy begins with Sylvie as he takes her glowing green hand before the blast, but the power certainly seems to emanate from both of them.</p><p data-characters=691 data-current-count=691 data-injectable=true>Even so, the pair don’t come close to matching Classic Loki’s wizardry as seen when the two met in the Void. Older and more experienced, Classic Loki is a representation of the power Loki’s magic could reach in the future, as he learns new ways to manipulate it. Classic Loki’s green energy blasts are presented as an impressive skill but one that can only be achieved after a lot of practice. In the same vein, Sylvie has also honed her enchantment skills, a power that greatly interests Loki, despite having used it occasionally and briefly in the past. Oh, and he can also do “shadow play” now, which is basically the ability to manipulate his shadows.</p><p data-characters=409 data-current-count=409 data-injectable=true>Even with this multiversal reasoning, this sudden inclusion of new powers in the Disney Plus show that had never shown up in any of Loki’s previous movies <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">feels a bit random</a>. While we’re hoping Marvel provides further explanation about how he’s developed them soon, it’s quite interesting that the franchise is using Loki’s stand-alone project to take his powers to new heights.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>What are Loki’s greatest powers?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=349 data-current-count=649 data-injectable=true>Let’s be honest, energy blasts are dull in comparison to the clever and playful possibilities of the power set that defines Loki, the trickster god. Shape-shifting, projecting illusions, duplicating, concealing his presence, manipulating/moving objects with his mind, and reading other people’s thoughts and memories are a lot more fun.</p><p data-characters=528 data-current-count=528 data-injectable=true>Loki’s famous for pretending to be other people (or animals, remember when he turned into a snake just so he could stab Thor?), for creating duplicates of himself, for generating objects at will, or for teleporting in short distances during fights. He’s also read Valkyrie’s memories once by touching her forehead, turned Thor into a frog when they were kids, and managed to mind-control Erik Selvig and even his father Odin. The man also loves his knives, and, quite honestly, his mind is his greatest asset.</p><p data-characters=233 data-current-count=233 data-injectable=false>As season 2 of Loki continues to explore his abilities, who knows how powerful he will become? After that brilliant display, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">while chasing after Hunter X-05 AKA Brad Wolfe</a> in episode 2, we’re eager to see more of his skill set.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedlr%2B3sctorqGZpGKus7GMpaakoaNivbDDxKuqZqGeYsGpsYymmKuulaF6pLXNnqSarJmYera6yK%2Bcq6uVYrWqv4ynnLBll6eyprqMm6Oaq6SoeqbEz6WYoqaVmXw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
