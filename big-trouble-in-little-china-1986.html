And the first 30 minutes of the movie gave me lots of room for hope. It was fast-moving, it was visually spectacular, it was exotic and lighthearted and filled with a spirit of adventure. But then, gradually, the movie began to recycle itself. It began to feel as if I was seeing the same thing more than once. After one amazing subterranean chamber had been survived and conquered, everybody fell down a chute into another one. By the end of the movie, I was just plain weary.</p><p>"Big Trouble in Little China" was directed by <a href=#>John Carpenter</a>, who has specialized in special-effects movies. He made "<a href=#>The Thing</a>" (1982), "Escape From New York" and "<a href=#>Christine</a>," but his best movie in recent years has been "<a href=#>Starman</a>," the one with <a href=#>Jeff Bridges</a> as the outer-space alien learning to be a human being. "Starman" was so good because it told a story that involved interesting characters. Special effects all by themselves aren't enough.</p><p>"Little China" doesn't seem to remember that. The movie stars <a href=#>Kurt Russell</a> as Jack Burton, a truck-driving adventurer in the Indiana Jones mode. He goes to the airport with his friend Wang Chi (<a href=#>Dennis Dun</a>), and while they're greeting a flight from China, Wang's girlfriend (<a href=#>Suzee Pai</a>) is abducted by bandits from Chinatown.</p><p>That sets up the rest of the movie, which is essentially one extended chase scene, as Russell, Dun and <a href=#>Kim Cattrall</a> plunge headlong into the mysteries beneath Chinatown. The key to the abduction is the fact that Wang's girlfriend has green eyes, rare for a Chinese woman, but invaluable for the dreaded Lo Pan (<a href=#>James Hong</a>), an incredibly ancient sorcerer who must draw on the power within those green eyes to restore his youth. Because Cattrall also has green eyes, it is obviously only a matter of time before Pai and Cattrall are both captives in the dragon's lair.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46boKBlpKe8tq7LnmSipl2htrXAy55knKCZo65ufZhxbQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
