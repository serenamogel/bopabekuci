But a new fan theory has given a whole new perspective on its hero Marty McFly.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=293 data-current-count=293 data-injectable=false>We’re nearly 40 years on from Back to the Feature’s cinematic debut in 1985, but new revelations (i.e. internet speculation) have seen the film now viewable through an entirely different lens: that the hero is actually an unintentional gay icon after he traveled back to the 1950s.</p><p data-characters=447 data-current-count=740 data-injectable=true>The fan theory was posited by /u/Pasta-hobo on /r/fantheories and has been met with both acclaim and utter disbelief, but somehow it’s brilliant nonetheless. The theory espouses that after he traveled to the past, George and Loraine both assumed Marty was gay because of, well, a lot of factors. Probably most humorously is because he didn’t want to have sex with his mother. Oh, and calling George his “dad” several times.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>(Back to the Future) Loraine and George thought Past Marty was gay.</a> from <a href=#>FanTheories</a></figure><p data-characters=251 data-current-count=551 data-injectable=true>It’s still insane, though. Commenters have declared it both incredibly stupid and also strangely inspired: for once it’s a fan theory about something other than Marvel or Star Wars! Also here’s an unholy comment nobody needs to see.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-205.png><p data-characters=305 data-current-count=605 data-injectable=true>Overall though, there’s a very clear retort to one of this theory’s arguments that gay people weren’t known of: there’d been public knowledge of gay people since way back into the 1800s. Hell, even during the Second World War there was major acknowledgment of gay people existing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-206.png><p data-characters=184 data-current-count=484 data-injectable=true>It’s a bonkers theory, but it now adds so much to any future rewatch of Back to the Future.
