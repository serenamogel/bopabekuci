Both <a href=# title="Ash Ketchum">Ash</a> and <a href=# title="Dawn (anime)">Dawn</a> rushed to catch Buneary, but Dawn was determined to battle the Pokémon after failing to catch a <a href=# title="Buneary (Pokémon)">Buneary</a> in her <a href=# title=DP002>previous</a> <a href=# title=DP004>attempts</a> to do so.

He used his Pikachu to battle Buneary, but it acted completely different than when battling Piplup before, covering its face with its fur. It then froze Ash, Dawn, and <a href=# title="Brock (anime)">Brock</a> with <a href=# title="Ice Beam (move)">Ice Beam</a> and started dancing with Pikachu. Pikachu later scolded Buneary for its actions, upsetting it and making it cry. Buneary stopped crying when it heard something. However, this did not prevent it from being locked inside a glass ball from <a href=# title="Team Rocket trio">Team Rocket</a>'s newest mecha. Pikachu offered to go with <a href=# title=Jessie>Jessie</a>, <a href=# title=James>James</a>, and <a href=# title="Meowth (Team Rocket)">Meowth</a> if they agreed to free Buneary, but the trio had no plans of letting Buneary go and just wanted to capture Pikachu for <a href=# title="Giovanni (anime)">their boss</a>. Using <a href=# title="Iron Tail (move)">Iron Tail</a>, Pikachu managed to break free and save Buneary. Together, they were able to wreck Team Rocket's mecha and then jump before it could explode, with Ash grabbing Pikachu and Buneary landing safely on Dawn's arms. Buneary was later asked if it would like to travel with Dawn. It agreed, but Dawn said they still should have a <a href=# title="Pokémon battle">Pokémon battle</a>.</p><p>This time, Piplup was prepared for Buneary's moves. Their battle began with Piplup using Bubble Beam, which Buneary dodged. Piplup followed with <a href=# title="Peck (move)">Peck</a>, only for Buneary to dodge again. When Piplup used another Bubble Beam, Buneary countered with Ice Beam. The two moves clashed, creating an explosion. Buneary then used the smoke to surprise Piplup with Dizzy Punch, but he was able to dodge and use Peck, hitting Buneary and nodding to Dawn so she could throw a <a href=# title="Poké Ball (item)">Poké Ball</a>. After a few seconds, Buneary was successfully <a href=# title="Caught Pokémon">caught</a>, joining Dawn on her <a href=# title="Pokémon journey">quest</a> to become a <a href=# title="Top Coordinator">Top Coordinator</a>.</p><p>Buneary made its stage debut in <i><a href=# title=DP012>Arrival of a Rival!</a></i>, where it was used in the <a href=# title="Contest Battle">Battle Round</a> of the <a href=# title="Jubilife City">Jubilife City</a> <a href=# title="Pokémon Contest">Pokémon Contest</a>. It was first seen defeating a <a href=# title="Bidoof (Pokémon)">Bidoof</a> to advance Dawn to the semifinals. There, it went up against <a href=# title="Zoey's Glameow">Zoey's Glameow</a>. Their battle began with Buneary using Ice Beam, which was countered by Glameow's <a href=# title="Shadow Claw (move)">Shadow Claw</a> and used to create a stunning contrast that cost Dawn a few points. After that, Buneary used Bounce and Glameow used its curled tail to jump and surprise Buneary with <a href=# title="Fury Swipes (move)">Fury Swipes</a>. Glameow proceeded with Iron Tail, but Buneary managed to stop the attack by using its ears to grab Glameow's tail. Seeing this, <a href=# title=Zoey>Zoey</a> ordered Glameow to spin its tail, making Buneary spin and sending it flying. Buneary fought back with Ice Beam, which Glameow managed to dodge. However, the <a href=# title="Ice (type)">Ice-type</a> <a href=# title=Move>move</a> ended up freezing the stage, making Glameow slip up and allowing Buneary to attack it repeatedly with Dizzy Punch and Bounce. When Glameow was about to be hit by another Dizzy Punch, it used Shadow Claw to break the ice covering the stage, sending shards towards Buneary before using Iron Tail to make it hit the ground. Time ran out after that and Buneary lost the battle on points, eliminating Dawn from the competition.</p><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/b/b4/Dawn_Buneary_vs_Maylene_Meditite.png/330px-Dawn_Buneary_vs_Maylene_Meditite.png decoding=async width=220 height=165 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Buneary battling Maylene's Meditite<p>In <i><a href=# title=DP052>Smells Like Team Spirit!</a></i>, Buneary was used alongside <a href=# title=Conway>Conway</a>'s <a href=# title="Slowking (Pokémon)">Slowking</a> in the semifinal round of the <a href=# title="Hearthome City Tag Battle Competition">Hearthome City Tag Battle Competition</a>.

Going up against <a href=# title="Meditite (Pokémon)">Meditite</a>, Buneary started the battle with its <a href=# title="Flying (type)">Flying-type</a> Bounce attack. However, the Meditate Pokémon used <a href=# title="Detect (move)">Detect</a> to sense and then avoid Buneary's move, preventing damage. After that, Meditite managed to hit Buneary with its <a href=# title="Drain Punch (move)">Drain Punch</a> despite its attempt to spin and dodge the attack. Buneary got up and used Ice Beam, <a href=# title="Freeze (status condition)">freezing</a> Meditite briefly as it used <a href=# title="Confusion (move)">Confusion</a> to break from the ice and direct the shards at Buneary. Thanks to its footwork skills, Buneary was able to avoid the ice shards, but Meditite used Confusion one more time to lift Buneary into the air then toss it down to the ground. By extending its rolled-up ears, Buneary softened the impact before using Bounce. Meditite then used Drain Punch and the two Pokémon clashed in mid-air, causing an explosion and rendering Buneary <a href=# title=Fainting>unable to continue battling</a>.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=DP078>Pruning a Passel of Pals!</a></i>, Buneary was used in the Battle Round of the <a href=# title="Wallace Cup">Wallace Cup</a>.

Dawn initially had trouble picking a design for herself and Buneary, but after remembering what <a href=# title=Hermione>Hermione</a> had told her earlier about Poké Stylists and Coordinators being one and the same, as well as <a href=# title=Zoey>Zoey</a>'s advice to focus on showcasing the Pokémon as they are always the main attraction, she got inspired and began designing again. The next day, Dawn and Buneary were seen wearing simple snow-themed outfits for the competition. During its performance, Buneary used its Ice Beam attack to create several ice pillars before displaying its jumping ability to the judges. This secured it a spot among the three finalists, along with <a href=# title="Ash's Pikachu">Ash's Pikachu</a> and <a href=# title=Cocoa>Cocoa</a>'s <a href=# title="Mismagius (Pokémon)">Mismagius</a>. After <a href=# title="Team Rocket trio">Team Rocket</a> interrupted the competition with their usual antics, Buneary used Bounce together with Paris's <a href=# title="Lopunny (Pokémon)">Lopunny</a> to destroy their <a href=# title="Team Rocket's mechas">mecha</a> and send them blasting off. Paris later announced Dawn and Buneary as the winners of the Hearthome Collection, congratulating Dawn for using simple accessories to show off Buneary.</p><p>Buneary was Dawn's choice for the <a href=# title=Appeal>Appeals Round</a> of the <a href=# title="Celestic Town">Celestic</a> Contest in <i><a href=# title=DP095>Battling The Generation Gap!</a></i>. She was sent out with a <a href=# class=mw-redirect title=Seal>Party Seal</a> and used Bounce to start its performance, jumping up high then spinning in the air. It proceeded with Ice Beam to freeze the stage and create a slide of ice so she could skate on it. After skating across the icy stage for a while, she used Dizzy Punch, allowing it to skate on her ears. However, she lost control of its rapid spinning movements and ended up flying across the hall. Seeing this, Dawn rushed to catch Buneary then told it to smile and pose as a way to make up for their mistake. The performance was praised by the judges, with <a href=# title="Raoul Contesta">Raoul Contesta</a> saying it showed off how cute Buneary can be and <a href=# title="Nurse Joy">Nurse Joy</a> commenting how much fun Buneary seemed to be having.

It became jealous of Pikachu and challenged him to a battle, but Buneary decided to fight instead. During the battle, Phione was able to take advantage of the proximity to the sea and confuse Buneary, but it eventually knocked it out with its Bounce attack. Upon seeing Phione leaving feeling down, Buneary said something to cheer it up, putting a smile on its face.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=DP114>Another One Gabites the Dust!</a></i>, Buneary was used in the Appeals Round of the <a href=# title="Chocovine Town">Chocovine</a> Contest.

The Trainer, named <a href=# title=Marilyn>Marilyn</a>, approached Dawn and asked her for a battle. Dawn accepted the challenge and used Buneary to battle Marilyn's <a href=# title="Cherubi (Pokémon)">Cherubi</a>. As Marilyn wanted to appreciate Cherubi's cute appearance a little longer, Dawn was the first to make a move, commanding Buneary to use Dizzy Punch. Despite being hit multiple times, Cherubi did not counterattack and so Buneary used Ice Beam. This time, Cherubi used <a href=# title="Protect (move)">Protect</a> to defend itself but acted as if it was taking damage from the attack. Upon seeing this, <a href=# title="Brock (anime)">Brock</a> interrupted the battle and gave Marilyn a lecture before telling her she would be disqualified if she refused to battle properly.

After that, it used Bounce to leap in the frozen bubbles, displaying its footwork and receiving compliments from <a href=# title=Marian>Marian</a> for doing so. It then used a variation of the technique it perfected in <i><a href=# title=DP017>Wild in the Streets!</a></i> and Piplup did the same while simultaneously using his Peck attack.
