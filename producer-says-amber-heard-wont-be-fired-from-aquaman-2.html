The actress will not be fired from the upcoming DC flick “Aquaman 2” despite ongoing pressure from ex-husband Johnny Depp’s fans.</p><p>The superhero film’s producer, Peter Safran, shut down speculation that Heard, 35, would be cut in an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadline</a>.</p><p>“I don’t think that we’re ever going to react to, honestly, pure fan pressure. You gotta do what you feel is best for the movie. We felt that if it’s James Wan and Jason Momoa, it should be Amber Heard. That’s really what it was,” Safran said.</p><p>Wan directed Heard and Momoa, 41, in 2018’s “<a href=#>Aquaman</a>,” which <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">earned</a> roughly $1.14 billion at the box office. The Hawaiian native played the title character and Heard portrayed his love interest, Mera.</p><p>“Listen, one is not unaware of what is going on in the Twitter-verse, but that doesn’t mean you have to react to it or take it as gospel or accede to their wishes,” Safran added. “You have to do what you feel is right for the film, and that’s really where we landed on it.”</p><p>The official title for the action-packed, water-filled sequel is “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom.” The film is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">currently in production</a> and scheduled for a theatrical release on Dec. 16, 2022.</p><p>A <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Change.org</a> petition to kick “The Danish Girl” star off the franchise <a href=#>surfaced in November 2020</a>. As of today, the online appeal has garnered over 1.8 million signatures.</p><p>Heard and Depp, 58, were married from 2015 until their divorce was finalized in 2017. Divorce proceedings were extremely contentious, as she accused the “Pirates of the Caribbean” actor of abuse. She was granted a temporary restraining order and the LAPD found no evidence of abuse at the time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/07/aquaman-amber-heard-03.jpg><p>In 2019, Depp alleged that Heard abused him and he then filed a defamation lawsuit against Heard. Last year, Depp lost his libel suit against British tabloid the Sun, which had reported he was abusive toward his ex-wife. The publication called Depp a “wife-beater” in an article detailing the ex-couple’s marital situation.</p><p>A spokesman for the Sun said&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the paper had “stood up and campaigned for the victims of domestic abuse</a>&nbsp;for over twenty years.” The rep continued, “Domestic abuse victims must never be silenced and we thank the Judge for his careful consideration and thank Amber Heard for her courage in giving evidence to the court.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3J7j3BmbGhfpb%2BwsNScnKtlo5bGtHnAppmeql2dsqK%2Bw2auqKakYq%2BmecWiqZ6cXZu%2FsLmMmqiumZ2Wu25%2Bjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
