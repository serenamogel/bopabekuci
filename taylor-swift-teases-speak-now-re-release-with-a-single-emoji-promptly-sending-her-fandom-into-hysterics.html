Just this morning, the pop star did what she does best and tossed us a sizeable Easter egg to her fandom on Twitter by teasing the possible release of her next re-recorded album, which, thanks to a single purple heart emoji, is believed to be her 2010 album Speak Now.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=254 data-current-count=254 data-injectable=false>Swift, who is currently on the road for her Eras Tour, just finished performing at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia. Ever the polite performer, she took to Twitter to thank her fans for forking up their hard-earned cash and showing up.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=355 data-current-count=609 data-injectable=true>“WOW Atlanta just… wow,” she wrote. “The band, dancers, and I can’t stop talking about how insanely magical it was playing for you guys the past 3 nights. You were always bouncing, dancing, screaming every lyric. And you created so many breathtaking moments for us, you know what I mean. Looove yooouuu.

The first is the purple heart for obvious reasons (the color theme for Speak Now is purple), but the second is her comment, “you know what I mean.” For those not in the know, “Mean” was one of Swift’s more popular singles from the 14-track album.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=374 data-current-count=374 data-injectable=false>Swift has a long and dedicated history of planting Easter eggs in her songs, announcements, outfits, interviews, etc… Compared to some of her others, this Speak Now Easter egg is hardly obscure. In fact, some could argue that the singer has grown less and less subtle with her hints since her tenth studio album Midnights released last year. And her fandom thinks so, too.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=674 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>speak now tv is coming <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/BtReKCztal</a></p>— luli (ts version) 🇦🇷 (@repshawley) <a href=#>May 1, 2023</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>idk why but you writing “NEXT 💜” is very suspicious at hinting speak now is NEXT… !</p>— stef (@itzsdc) <a href=#>May 1, 2023</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>UM… the bracelets flashing PURPLE 3 times at the end of the night, Taylor Nation RETWEETING a picture of this happening, the "3 nights", the 3 o's, the 3 u's, the 💜,Taylor Nation and their goodnight post with ENCHANTED LYRICS?!

The remaining albums include Speak Now, 1989, and Reputation, all of which were released under Big Machine Records. Due to a<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> legal dispute over the ownership of her masters</a>, Swift left Big Machine Records for Republic Records in 2018 in partnership with Taylor Swift Productions Inc with the intent to re-release her entire discography.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=390 data-current-count=390 data-injectable=false>Now that Swift’s five-year copyright lawsuit for her hit song “Shake It Off” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">has been dropped</a>, many fans have speculated that 1989 would be the singer’s next re-release. However, the number of Easter eggs, including today’s, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">pointing to Speak Now</a> indicates Swift is looking to close that gap between Fearless and Red. (Speak Now was actually released in between those two albums.)</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=690 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>🚨| Theory Alert!</p><p>In her recent Twitter post, Taylor says “NEXT 💜” indcating that Speak Now TV is next.</p><p>BUT, she also says Looove yooouuu with 3 o’s in Love, and 3 o’s and 3 u’s in you.</p><p>3 + 3 + 3 = 9</p><p>Speak Now TV announcement on May 9th? <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/z55MhQk7zt</a></p>— swifted.

Much more likely, however, is that Swift will just continue to drop Easter eggs like breadcrumbs between now and the end of her Eras Tour, at which point she can reasonably spend more time promoting her next re-release.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=237 data-current-count=237 data-injectable=false>In fact, knowing Swift, we may very well get our biggest Easter egg (or even an official announcement) at the end of the Eras Tour, which concludes on Aug. 9 in Los Angeles, California.
