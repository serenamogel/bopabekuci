itemprop=articleBody><p><span>John Goodman won the hearts of TV lovers with his performance in the ABC sitcom&nbsp;</span><span>Roseanne</span><span>&nbsp;, which aired from 1988 to 1997 and then in 2018.&nbsp;The actor and comedian cracked ribs with his weird mind, which earned him the 1993 Golden Globe Award for Best Actor.&nbsp;Since then he has been in tons of TV productions spanning movies, sitcoms and other shows.</span></p><p><span>You will surely remember him from the film adaptation of the animated series&nbsp;</span><span>Flintstone</span><span>&nbsp;which was released in 1994.&nbsp;Goodman first appeared on television in the ’80s and has remained relevant ever since.&nbsp;Not only is he known as “Dan Coner” in Roseanne, there’s a lot to know about the funny actor.&nbsp;Here are lesser-known facts about John Goodman, including his personal life and weight loss.</span></p><h2><strong><span>John Goodman’s bio</span></strong></h2><p><span>He was born on June 20, 1952 in St. Louis, Missouri, USA.&nbsp;He lost his father to a heart attack and grew up with his mother and siblings.&nbsp;At first, Goodman was fond of sports.&nbsp;He attended Affton High School, was involved in football and competed in school competitions.&nbsp;After graduating in 1970, he received a football scholarship and transferred to Southwest Missouri State University, where he continued to play football.&nbsp;However, his football dreams were shattered after he sustained an injury that prevented him from playing.</span></p><p><span>All hope was not lost for Goodman;&nbsp;he soon switched to studying theater, where he met notable figures such as Kathleen Turner and Tess Harper.&nbsp;After graduating, he moved to New York to look for better opportunities.&nbsp;He started out with voice acting and commercial jobs before appearing on Broadway’s&nbsp;</span><span>Loose Ends</span><span>&nbsp;.</span></p><p><span>In 1982, he landed his first film role in the film&nbsp;</span><span>Eddie Macon’s Run</span><span>&nbsp;That has garnered some positive reviews.&nbsp;A number of other films followed, and the actor gradually gained prominence.&nbsp;He appeared in the Broadway musical&nbsp;</span><span>Big River</span><span>&nbsp;in 1985 before landing another major role in the comedy&nbsp;</span><span>True Stories</span><span>&nbsp;the following year.</span></p><span>In the late ’80s, Goodman had a major role in the sitcom&nbsp;</span><span>Roseanne</span><span>&nbsp;(1989-1990), which was considered the most-watched program in America at the time.&nbsp;He also acted in a few Coen Brothers films, some of which included;&nbsp;</span><span>Barton Fink</span><span>&nbsp;(1991),&nbsp;</span><span>The Big Lebowski</span><span>&nbsp;(1998),&nbsp;</span><span>Oh Brother Where Art Thou?&nbsp;</span><span>(2000) and others.&nbsp;He went ahead to make appearances on shows like&nbsp;</span><span>Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>The Western Wing,</span><span>&nbsp;all directed by Aaron Sorkin;&nbsp;and also got a starring role in&nbsp;</span><span>Flintstones</span><span>&nbsp;(1994).</span><p><span>The 2000s brought more promising roles for the actor.&nbsp;He was cast in&nbsp;</span><span>Coyote Ugly</span><span>&nbsp;The film is based on the chain of bars Coyote Ugly Saloon in the US.&nbsp;He was cast in the film&nbsp;</span><span>Beyond the Sea</span><span>&nbsp;which was based on Bobby Darin’s life.&nbsp;In 2013, the actor received the prestigious title “Disney Legend”, and also played the character of the North Carolina Senator in the comedy&nbsp;</span><span>Alpha House</span><span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;In 2018, Goodman made a return for the revival on ABC&nbsp;alongside some of the original cast of&nbsp;</span><span>Roseanne .</span></p><h2><strong><span>Wealth (income and earnings)</span></strong></h2><p><span>John Goodman is sitting on an enviable net worth of $65million as estimated by many sources.&nbsp;The actor and comedian made a whopping $250,000 per episode during the revival of the acclaimed Roseanne series.&nbsp;Though the talented actor doesn’t fuss about his financial situation, it’s nothing new to the public that he’s enjoying a comfortable life with his family.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Personal life – wife, children</span></strong></h2><p><span>Contrary to his noisy career, John Goodman has common sense and an admirable personal life, which he does not always successfully hide from the media.&nbsp;A traditional family man, Goodman is married to his wife Annabeth Hartzog, with whom he has tied the knot since 1989.&nbsp;Goodman’s marriage is also a source of inspiration for other entertaining couples in the industry.&nbsp;They have one daughter, Molly Evangeline together.</span></p><h2><strong><span>weight loss</span></strong></h2><p><span>Goodman’s story cannot be told entirely without a mention of his weight loss journey.&nbsp;The actor, who weighed 400 pounds in the previous Roseanne series, lost a streak of over 100 pounds in the reboot.&nbsp;How did he survive the journey he started in 2015?&nbsp;First, Goodman had to cut down on some things like alcohol and junk.&nbsp;He also employed a personal trainer – Mackie Shilstone – who introduced him to workable exercise routines.&nbsp;Goodman started from there, training six days a week to reach his current height.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Is John Goodman dead or alive?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Death rumors are common among celebrities, but what? if there’s a shred of truth in them?&nbsp;What if Goodman really was dead?&nbsp;Reports of Goodman’s death made headlines in 2017 after a revival of the Roseanne series was announced.</span></p><p><span>The most common question making rounds on the internet was what about the dead John Goodman?&nbsp;Goodman’s character (Dan) died in the previous series, but his character was brought back to life in the reboot.&nbsp;As of 2018, Goodman is still alive in real life.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Other important facts</span></strong></h2><ul><li><span>John Goodman’s daughter, Molly, is not far removed from her father’s industry.&nbsp;She is a production assistant in the film industry.</span></li><li><span>During the heat of Roseanne Barr’s racial uproar, it was feared that the actor might suffer a financial collapse along with other cast members on the series as ABC wanted to cancel the show as a sanction for Barr.&nbsp;But Goodman remains steadfast as he still lives a comfortable life with his family.</span></li><li><span>For those who don’t now, John Goodman was a bouncer, a job his height allows him to easily fit into.</span></li></ul><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><span class=vce-square></span><h2
