Due to the high-profile event, the altercation was observed by several celebrities. At the time, Carson Daly told Access (via <a href=#>Today</a>), "From our vantage point it looked like Tommy Lee went over to say hello to [Sean "Diddy" Combs] 'cause Kid Rock was out of his seat."&nbsp;He continued, "Kid Rock came back to his seat and all hell broke loose."&nbsp;According to bystanders, the awards show fight only resulted in one punch being thrown. "I can't say who started it. Tommy Lee took a blow," radio personality Sway Calloway said.</p><p dir=ltr>Afterwards, the Mötley Crüe drummer took to his blog to give his rendition of the dust up. "Here I am minding my own biz [when] I get a tap on the shoulder from Kid Pebble," Lee wrote in September 2007, via <a href=#>People</a>. According to Lee, he tried to greet Rock cordially at first, but the friendly gesture was not reciprocated. "He punches me in the face ... well if ya wanna call it that!? ... more like a b**** slap!" Lee blogged.</p><p dir=ltr>Following the fisticuffs, Lee and Rock were both removed from the VMAs. Initially, Rock denied ever throwing a punch. "I never hit nobody for nothing before," the "Bawitdaba" singer said, per <a href=#>MTV</a>. Later, Rock further opened up about the fight.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamhlaYJ0hI6tpqalqWK5prHSZp2erZRixKrAx2aiopxdp7ykt4yfrKWkqWKyubzLmqCnnZRk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
