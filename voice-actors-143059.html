Gates of Time that stand out enough to warrant voice actors, three of which are three-fifths of the main protagonists.<p><b>Michael Ayers</b>: Me, since I've always pictured my voice to be the most similar to this character.<br><i>Maximillion Pegasus and Weevil Underwood</i>: Being canon characters, they would be best suited to having their original VAs from the anime (or close enough voices from other VAs, like LittleKuriboh for Pegasus, since his Pegasus voice is similar to canon Pegasus).<br><b>Kaiba</b>: LittleKuriboh, for similar reasons as him being my second choice for Pegasus, only in a far more frequent role (and, something he might like, as it would be a serious role). His Kaiba voice for Yu-Gi-Oh The Abridged series was in my mind instantly when I first conceived this character, and the voices are similar enough, yet different enough, to invoke feelings of the original Kaiba with being a different, albeit related person (unlike the Funimation voice actress who played kid Goku (Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball GT) and kid Gohan (original Dragon Ball Z)).<br><b>(currently) nameless thief</b>: I don't really have anything definite for this guy yet, but really, any of the other Dragon Ball Z Abridged VAs of Team Four Star who voiced a DBZ villain (LK is excluded because, as Freeza proved, he does a really great Evil Brit voice, but that's not what I'm looking for). Ideally, something like Ganxingba's Android 17 with a little more "cliche villainy" added in (the character does do the whole "card-carrying villain" - pun intended - schtick as part of his actual character, 'cause he likes playing that role).<br><b>Alexander Garnet</b>: And once again with TFS (I swear, this is nothing more than a coincidence), I'd have to say KaiserNeko. especially with something like his Trunks voice. This character is in his late teens, which I believe Future Trunks is during the Android and Cell sagas (don't quote me on that), which seems like a good baseline.</p><p>More to come as I introduce more important characters, although you can focus on canon characters with their actual VAs (or something close).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorPAq5uepl6jsrV706GpnpmUqHy3u8icnGaZk6m8s7%2BNamtsaGVufLGtxp5kaw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
